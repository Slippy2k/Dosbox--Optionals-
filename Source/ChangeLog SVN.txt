r4063 Remove some unnecessary things from prior commits; oops.
r4062 Implement update region in mouse driver; only text modes for now. Fixes mouse pointer problems in Microsoft Programmer's Library.
r4061 Add patch #265 to correct parameters and clock rate for some EGA modes. Also apply the yellow->brown fix to EGA text modes as well.
r4060 Improve MSCDEX GetDirectoryEntry function: skip associated files, and handle HSF differences in canonicalized structure. Also combine Copyright, Abstract, and Documentation filename functions.
r4059 silence warning 4018, unsigned char/unsigned char => (signed) int (thanks wjp)
r4058 Move definition of LocalFile to header file, requested by bruenor41, makes sense to make it available at a larger scope. 
r4057 Fix some issues with the detection of the configure option
r4056 Move dddraw detection to a configure option. Requested by DosFreak.
r4055 Fix address calculation for 16bit DMA transfers on GUS
r4054 empty is always constant, while size can be linear on older gcc versions. (wjp)
r4053 Add trivial speed up to debugger.
r4052 Remove dangling comma. (Thanks for spotting it hail-to-the-ryzen)
r4051 We don't use MFC, maybe this helps the compilation guides of DosFreak.
r4050 Zero INT 68h vector on CGA machine type. Helps default speed of Popcorn game.
r4049 Fix bug 467.
r4048 Implement waiting for retrace in VBE functions. Remove range checks in protected mode functions, consistent with UniVBE and other VBE implementations. Fixes hang and graphics glitches in Jack Orlando.
r4047 Process repeated reset commands without delay. Fixes MPU detection in several games. Correct ACK for reset: entirely absent with dumb setting (mpu401=uart), and also absent when returning to intelligent mode from UART mode.
r4046 Point DOS redirected interrupts at a plain IRET as in real DOS. Prevents erroneous detection of an active debugger, which for example fixes sound in Microleague Football 2.
r4045 Remove error exit for unknown functions of INT 17h. Fixes a DOS shell program.
r4044 Add patch 272 as this is how all commandline options are handled.
r4043 Change scope of ratioremoved for logging. Introduce a hardcoded limit of 2000000, if no limit was specified in the options file. Thanks for all the help with loggging: leileilol, James-F, sndwv, BBP and P4R4D0X.
r4042 Introduce a penalty for a lot of idling, which changes the up and downscale algorithm, as the chance of having errors in the input data is a lot larger when there is a lot of idling. The upscale has its strength reduced and the downscale has it increased.
r4041 When downscaling multiple times in a raw, ensure a minimum amount of strength
r4040 Lower the max ratio limit slightly. Add a new ratio limit when the cycles are sufficiently high.
r4039 Introduce a random sleep period, which activates after 3 short sleeps in one frame.
r4038 Change adaptive rate parameters slightly, so that is a less jumpy
r4037 Increase prebuffer slightly, as certain things (create new surfaces) take a longer time nowadays.
r4036 Remove come c++11 stuff and hope I don't break anything
r4035 Update automake files for mame files
r4034 Remove some unneeded c++11 that's not even compiling properly
r4033 Make the dosbox sound card implementations use the mame files directly 
r4032 Add emu.h header to make the mame files work without too many changes. Small changes to remove or disable timer and update handlers
Add cheap sample rate conversion to the sn76496 emulation
r4031 Clean mame versions from 10 August 2017
r4030 Try latest mame sound cores
r4029 Repair a logic error introduced in r3816. Now both cases use an appropriate average.
r4028 make increaseticks a separate function and rewrite it for easier reading. The behaviour is identical. No fixes!
r4027 Otherwise debugging makes no sense. (core_dyn_x86.cpp)
r4026 As we zero out the memory on startup for a long time now. This should not exit anymore. Leaving the warning for now.
r4025 Fix issue with debugger not executing dosbox callbacks in stepover
r4024 Forgot to initiliaze a field. Thanks Mok (hardware.cpp)
r4023 Correct an oversight in I/O exceptions. Fixes bug #460.
r4022 Update mixer volume calculations for the SBPRO1,2 and SB16. 
r4021 Year Update (Only Update the Copyright Lciense year in the sources to 2017)
r4020 Make IRQ generation in Write_MCR consistent with ComputeInterrupts, when op2 changes. Rename variables for clarity.
r4019 Revert mixer to request data in the device rate instead of the mixer rate. Fixes bug #457.
r4018 update midconfig helplines to reflect namesupport.
r4017 Add support for selecting midi devices by name to win32 midi. Rewritten patch of rcblanke.
r4016 Add experimental name support to configmidi for coremidi
r4015 Silence a warning (midi.cpp)
r4014 Turn logging off again. (gus.cpp)
r4013 Add some spaces for readability and update the position after forwarding to hopefully improve sound in GOB2.
r4012 Lower default adlib volume with 2.5dB after measurements by James-F. ( https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?f=46&t=49683 )
r4011 Not sure how that ended up there. (mixer.cpp)
r4010 Correct oscillator frequency used in the gameblaster. Thanks OPLx, Great Hierophant and NewRisingSun. Reported on VOGONS: 38350.
r4009 Handle errant IRQs as a real BIOS does. Fixes Tandy DAC in Chuck Yeager's Air Combat. Also remove r3263 workaround, as it's no longer needed.
r4008 Correct INT 15h function 6 to return error. Prevents Cyrus Chess from erroneously detecting an Amstrad system.
r4007 Frisbee compilation fix. (Not Used, Because OpenGL and we are using SDL,OpenGL/OpenGL3)
